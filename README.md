VisualBasic
===========

First attempts at VB on my own!

This repo will feature some of my most basic Visual Basic Projects. This is a language that I picked up on my own so please forgive any 'bad VB practices'

These folders can be moved into your Visual Basic IDE Projects folder. Use the .sln  (Solution) file to open the project
